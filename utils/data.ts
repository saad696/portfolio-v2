    bio: `Full Stack Dev (Specializing in Frontend) with 5 years under my belt, working with MERN and MEAN stacks. I've done everything - from building websites for local restaurants to leading government projects for Digital India and WHO. At Brandlock, I cut bundle sizes by 35%, built drag-and-drop tools that boosted engagement by 18%, and migrated entire tech stacks. When not coding, I'm either at the gym, riding my bike, or grabbing coffee. Love building stuff that actually makes a difference!`,
